Another reason was to expose myself to a big project so I could build common things you find on a lot of websites(auth, infinite scrolling, CRUD capability, etc). What really made me spark an interest in making a social media project, was that I originally wanted a place to share recipes and beers with friends. I worked on it for a while, scrapped it, and turned it into Chirp instead!", "I have learned a lot from this project and have grown as a developer. I've also had plenty of road bumps along the way. Although I've had a love-hate relationship with this project I still want to add more. If time permits, I would love to integrate a proper search engine and also a favorites page!"],
