				"While at Love Together, I spearheaded front end development. I developed and maintained user interfaces for our web application, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all platforms. I also contributed to the development of the company's internal design system, creating reusable components to improve development efficiency and consistency across projects. Some examples include reusable input fields, a modal wrapper, and a multi step form. Additionally, I collaborated with the back-end development team to integrate front-end code with back-end systems and services.",
